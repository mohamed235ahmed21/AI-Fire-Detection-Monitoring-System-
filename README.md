## 🚀 Overview

This project uses a custom fire dataset to train a YOLOv8 object detection model capable of identifying fire regions in images. The trained model is exposed through a FastAPI REST API, making it easy to integrate into web, mobile, or monitoring applications.

The system supports:

- Custom YOLOv8 training
- Model evaluation and performance analysis
- Real-time image inference
- REST API integration using FastAPI
- ONNX model export
- Production deployment

## 📂 Dataset

The model was trained on a custom fire detection dataset exported in YOLOv8 format.

Example dataset configuration:

```yaml
train: train/images
val: valid/images

nc: 1

names:
  - fire
```

Dataset structure:

```text

│
├── train/
│   ├── images/
│   └── labels/
│
├── valid/
│   ├── images/
│   └── labels/

└── test/
    ├── images/
    └── labels/
```

## 🏋️ Model Training

Training was performed using YOLOv8 with data augmentation and cosine learning rate scheduling.

Example training configuration:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO("yolov8s.pt")

results = model.train(
    data="data.yaml",
    imgsz=640,
    batch=32,
    epochs=100,
    patience=20,
    optimizer="SGD",
    cos_lr=True,
    lr0=0.01,
    mosaic=1.0,
    copy_paste=0.1,
    degrees=3.0,
    fliplr=0.5,
    hsv_h=0.015,
    hsv_s=0.7,
    hsv_v=0.4
)
```

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

The model is evaluated using standard object detection metrics:

### mAP@50
Measures detection quality when IoU ≥ 0.50.

### mAP@50:95
A stricter metric that averages performance across IoU thresholds from 0.50 to 0.95.

### Precision
Measures how many predicted fire detections are actually correct.

### Recall
Measures how many real fire instances were successfully detected.

### F1 Score
Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.

Example validation results:

```text
mAP@50      = 0.860
mAP@50:95   = 0.634
Precision   = 0.783
Recall      = 0.789
F1 Score    = 0.786
```

---

## 📈 Training Analysis

Training performance is monitored using:

- mAP curves
- Precision & Recall curves
- F1 Score curves
- Box Loss
- Classification Loss
- DFL Loss
- Precision-Recall Curve
- Confusion Matrix

These metrics help evaluate convergence and model stability during training.

---

## 🧠 Understanding the Loss Functions

### Box Loss
Measures how accurately the predicted bounding box matches the ground truth.

### Classification Loss (Cls Loss)
Measures classification accuracy of detected objects.

### DFL Loss (Distribution Focal Loss)
Measures the precision of bounding box edge localization.

Lower values indicate better performance.

## 🔍 Running Inference

### Image Inference

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO("best.pt")

results = model.predict(
    source="fire.jpg",
    conf=0.25,
    save=True
)
```

### Access Detection Results

```python
for result in results:
    for box in result.boxes:
        print("Confidence:", float(box.conf))
        print("Coordinates:", box.xyxy.tolist())
```
